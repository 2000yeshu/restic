Enhancement: Improve the ETA displayed during backup

# Describe the problem in the past tense, the new behavior in the present
# tense. Mention the affected commands, backends, operating systems, etc.
# Focus on user-facing behavior, not the implementation.

Restic's backup command displayed an ETA that did not adapt when the rate
of progress made during the backup changed during the course of the
backup. Restic now uses recent progress when computing the ETA. It is
important to realize that the estimate may still be wrong, because restic
cannot predict the future, but the hope is that the ETA will be more
accurate in most cases.
