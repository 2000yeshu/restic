Enhancement: Keep oldest snapshot when there aren't enough snapshots

The `forget` command does not preserve the oldest snapshot incase the 
keep-* parameters are not satisfied, which led to users not being able to
preserve old data. Now, restic will always preserve the oldest snapshot 
whenever any of the keep-* options to the `forget` command are not 
satisfied.
