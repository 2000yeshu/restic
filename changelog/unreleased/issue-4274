Bugfix: Improve lock refresh handling when using standby

If the restic process was stopped or the host running restic entered standby
during a long running operation such as a backup, this resulted in the
operation failing with `Fatal: failed to refresh lock in time`. We've reworked
the lock refresh such that restic first checks whether it is safe to continue
the current operation and only throws an error if not.
